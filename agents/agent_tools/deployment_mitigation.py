    """
    Roll back a service to a previous version.

    Use this tool when you need to quickly mitigate issues caused by a problematic
    deployment. This tool is essential for emergency response when a new deployment
    is causing service degradation or outages.

    This tool initiates a rollback operation to return the specified service to a
    previous known-good version, helping to restore service availability and
    functionality quickly.

    Example response:
        {
            "service": "payment-service",

            "timestamp": "2023-04-01T15:30:45Z"
        }

    Notes:
        - Performs an immediate rollback to the specified version
        - Returns the status of the rollback operation in real-time
        - Can target a specific deployment ID if provided
        - Provides a timestamp of when the rollback was completed
        - Should be used as part of an incident response plan

    Args:
        service (str): The service to roll back.
                      Example: "payment-service" or "api-gateway"
        version (str): The version to roll back to.
                      Example: "v1.2.3" or "release-20230401"

    Restart a service or specific instances of a service.

    Use this tool when you need to refresh a service that is experiencing issues that
    might be resolved by a restart, such as memory leaks, stale connections, or hung
    processes. This tool is useful for quick remediation without changing versions.

    This tool initiates a restart operation for either an entire service or specific
    instances of a service, helping to restore normal operation without a full
    deployment or rollback.

    Update configuration for a service.

    Use this tool when you need to modify a service's configuration to address issues
    without redeploying or restarting the entire service. This tool is valuable for
    making runtime adjustments to service behavior, such as timeouts, retry policies,
    or feature flags.

    This tool applies configuration changes to a running service, which can help
    mitigate issues by adjusting service parameters without requiring a full

    Notes:
        - Changes take effect immediately without requiring a full restart

    Scale a service to a specified number of replicas.

    Use this tool when you need to adjust the capacity of a service to handle changes
    in load or to mitigate performance issues. This tool is particularly useful during
    incidents where a service is under high load or experiencing resource constraints.

    This tool adjusts the number of running instances (replicas) of a service, which
    can help distribute load, improve availability, or reduce resource contention.

    Example response:

    Notes:
        - Scaling operations may take time to complete fully
        - Useful for addressing performance issues during traffic spikes
        - Can be used to both scale up (increase replicas) or scale down (decrease replicas)
        - Provides a timestamp of when the scaling operation was initiated
